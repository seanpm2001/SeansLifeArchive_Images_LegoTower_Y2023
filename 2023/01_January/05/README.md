I skipped my weekly session this week, as I didn't have the time. I forgot to charge my phone last night, and it took over 4 hours to charge, thus destroying the timeslot for today. I hope to not skip out on a 4th consecutive week. - 2022, Thursday, August 25th

I had a long length afternoon session this week (returning from a 3-4 week hiatus) and played for a very long amount of time (about 50 minutes or longer) doing some collection, elevator trips, and piece collection. I quit after restocking 2 of 3 / 3 of 3 of several floors. I completed 5 quests today, and made a decent amount of bux from elevator visits and many quests. I began building my 58th floor today (a residential level) floors now cost over 2.3 million coins to build. I also collected several pieces, now owning over half of all pieces as of this version of the game. I had a good time playing today. I eventually forced myself to quit. - 2022, Thursday, September 1st
